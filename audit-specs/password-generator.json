A 5-word passphrase from a 7,776-word list (e.g., <code>tree-giant-blue-lamp-ocean</code>) has $7776^5$ combinations, which is about $2.8 \\times 10^{19}$ or <strong>~64.6 bits</strong> of entropy.

A good password manager (like Bitwarden, 1Password, or Proton Pass) encrypts your \"vault\" of passwords with a single, strong \"master password.\" This allows you to use a unique, 100+ bit random password (like <code>7k!z@P#r&Q...</code>) for every single website, which you never have to remember. You only need to remember your one, strong master passphrase.</p> </details> <details> <summary>How often should I change my passwords?</summary> <p>The old advice of \"change your password every 90 days\" is now considered <strong>outdated</strong> by NIST. Changing passwords frequently encourages people to create weak, memorable patterns (e.g., `Spring2024!`, `Summer2024!`). It's now recommended to: <ol> <li>Create a very strong, high-entropy password (or passphrase).</li> <li><strong>Never change it</strong>, unless you have a specific reason to believe it has been compromised (e.g., you get a data breach notification from a service).</li> </ol> </p> </details> <details> <summary>What's the difference between a password and a passphrase?</summary> <p>They are functionally the same, but the terms describe their composition: <ul> <li>A <strong>password</strong> typically refers to a string of characters (<code>k%7BqP!9$G</code>).</li> <li>A <strong>passphrase</strong> typically refers to a sequence of words (<code>correct-horse-battery-staple</code>).</li> </ul> Modern security guidelines encourage long passphrases because they can have equal or greater entropy while being far easier for a human to remember.</p> </details> <details> <summary>What is a brute-force attack?</summary> <p>A brute-force attack is an attempt to guess a password by systematically trying every possible combination. An \"offline\" attack is one where the attacker has obtained a copy of the encrypted password database and can use powerful, specialized hardware to make trillions of guesses per second without being locked out. Our \"Time to Crack\" estimate is based on this worst-case scenario.</p> </details> <details> <summary>Why can't I just use a word and add a number and symbol?</summary> <p>You can, but this is a predictable human pattern. Attackers know you'll take `password` and turn it into `Password!`, `Password123`, or `P@ssword1!`. These patterns are among the first things they try. True randomness, derived from a large pool (like all characters or a large wordlist), is exponentially more secure.</p> </details> </section> <div class=\"mt-8 p-4 bg-gray-50 border border-gray-200 rounded-lg text-sm text-gray-600\"> <p><strong>Tool developed by Ugo Candido.</strong> Security content reviewed by the CalcDomain Editorial Board.<br> Last accuracy review: <time datetime=\"2025-10-26\">October 26, 2025</time></p> </div> </article> </section> <aside class=\"w-full lg:w-1/3\"> <div class=\"sticky top-24 space-y-6\"> <div class=\"bg-gray-200 h-72 rounded-lg flex items-center justify-center text-gray-500\"> Ad Placement (300×600) </div> <div class=\"bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-md\"> <h3 class=\"font-bold text-lg mb-3\">Why use this generator</h3> <ul class=\"list-disc list-inside text-sm text-gray-600 space-y-2\"> <li><strong>Instant Strength Analysis:</strong> See your password's entropy (in bits) and estimated crack time.</li> <li><strong>NIST-Compliant:</strong> Our methodology is based on modern security standards from NIST.</li> <li><strong>Memorable & Secure:</strong> Generate easy-to-remember passphrases that are stronger than complex, short passwords.</li> <li><strong>100% Secure & Private:</strong> All generation and calculation happens <strong>in your browser</strong>.
