      "raw": "Let each disposal i have proceeds P_i, allowable costs C_i, and gain g_i = P_i - C_i. We split gains by category: residential property (prop) vs other assets (other). 1) Aggregate gains and losses: G_prop = Σ max(g_i, 0) for property G_other = Σ max(g_i, 0) for other L_disposals = Σ max(-g_i, 0) over all disposals L_input = losses entered by user (≥ 0) L_total = L_disposals + L_input Gross gains (before AEA): G_gross = G_prop + G_other Net gains before AEA: G_net = max(0, G_gross - L_total) 2) Annual Exempt Amount (AEA): AEA_y = { 12,300 (2022/23), 6,000 (2023/24), 3,000 (2024/25) } for individuals For trusts (simplified): AEA_trust = AEA_y / 2 Apply AEA after losses: T = max(0, G_net - AEA) To preserve rate accuracy, we carry category breakdown through: Losses applied with priority to property (higher potential rate), then other. AEA applied to remaining gains with the same priority. 3) Rate interaction with income (Individuals only): Basic rate band B = 37,700 Unused basic band U = max(0, B - taxable_income) Split taxable gains between basic and higher bands to minimize tax: Allocate U first to the category with larger rate differential (Δ = higher_rate - basic_rate). Tax due: CGT = G_basic_prop * r_prop_basic + G_high_prop * r_prop_high + G_basic_other * r_other_basic + G_high_other * r_other_high Rates: 2022/23 and 2023/24: r_other_basic = 10%, r_other_high = 20% r_prop_basic = 18%, r_prop_high = 28% 2024/25: r_other_basic = 10%, r_other_high = 20% r_prop_basic = 18%, r_prop_high = 24% Trusts (simplified): All gains taxed at higher rates; no basic band."
