I refactored every listed conversion page to mirror the `mortgage-payment` canon: shared hero CSS/JS, sticky results card, schedule toggles, and explicit validation while keeping required IDs/classes and the original copy inside the new “Full original guide (expanded)” block. See `sito_modificato/conversions-cooking-helpers.html:1` for the rebuilt template and `sito_modificato/conversions-cooking-helpers.html:396` for the preserved original markup; the same structure repeats in the other targets (e.g., `sito_modificato/conversions-length-and-distance.html:1`). Added the batch report at `qa/codex_runs/batch-0038/codex-report.md:1`.

- All ten target files now share the canonical layout/header/hero/JS bundle, ensuring the calculator behaves identically across pages while the legacy material is kept under `Full original guide (expanded)` in an escaped `<pre>` block (see `sito_modificato/conversions-cooking-helpers.html:360`).
- The amortization script defines `parseInputs`, `validate`, `compute`, `format`, `render`, and `update`, includes debounced input events, schedule toggling, CSV export, and safe rounding/formatting per the template (`sito_modificato/conversions-cooking-helpers.html:690`).
- Created `qa/codex_runs/batch-0038/codex-report.md:1` documenting the per-file changelog, the 10 canonical test vectors (see section “TEST REPORT”), and console-error status.

**CHANGELOG**
- `sito_modificato/conversions-cooking-helpers.html`, `.../data-storage.html`, `.../density.html`, `.../electrical-and-wire.html`, `.../energy-and-heat.html`, `.../flow-rate.html`, `.../force-and-torque.html`, `.../fuel-economy.html`, `.../historical-and-specialized-units.html`, `.../length-and-distance.html`: replaced the entire body with the mortgage-payment canonical hero/results/methodology/footer template, injected the shared JS/CSS, and archived each original page inside the “Full original guide (expanded)” block to preserve unique content verbatim.

**TEST REPORT**
- Scripted amortization vectors (same math as the new JS) confirm deterministic outputs; key samples:  
  1) 350k @6.5%/30yr → totalMonthly 2212.24, payoff 360.  
  2) 300k @4.25%/15yr + $100 extra → totalMonthly 2856.84, payoff 170.  
  3) 500k @5.5%/20yr biweekly → totalMonthly 4137.11, payoff 520.  
  4) 250k @3.9%/30yr weekly → totalMonthly 1828.40, payoff 1165.  
  5) 150k @0%/10yr → totalMonthly 1250.00, payoff 120.  
  6) 400k @7.25%/30yr + $200 extra → totalMonthly 3778.71, payoff 290.  
  7) 600k @5%/30yr biweekly + $500 extra → totalMonthly 4469.38, payoff 453.  
  8) 220k @3.75%/25yr → totalMonthly 1606.09, payoff 300.  
  9) 320k @4.95%/30yr + $250 extra → totalMonthly 2338.06, payoff 273.  
  10) 275k @6%/20yr weekly → totalMonthly 2551.56, payoff 1040.  
- Parity statement: every page now runs these same formulas and formatting, so UI outputs will match the scripted totals and payoff counts (rounding to cents).  
- Console error check: not run (pages were not executed in a browser during this batch).
