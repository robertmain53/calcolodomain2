- Rebuilt `sito_modificato/frame-size.html#L1` around the canonical hero layout (header, split inputs/results, sticky KPIs, how-to/methodology, meta footer) while moving the original FAQ/data sections into “Full original guide (expanded)” so no unique guidance was lost.
- Added the required parse/validate/compute/format/render flow with deterministic rounding and input reset/debounce handling, plus the canonical formula/citation/changelog badges and responsive styles dictated by the mortgage reference.
- Documented the limited scope, planned vectors, and missing console verification in `qa/codex_runs/batch-0072/codex-report.md#L1`; the report lists 10 representative frame-size test vectors even though no automatic test run occurred this session.
- Testing: not executed (only planned vectors provided above to match the deterministic formula); console error check could not run because the page was not rendered in-browser.
- Next steps: apply the same canonical structure/JS contract to the remaining nine target pages, then run the ≥10-vector verification plus console checks for each file before finalizing the batch.
