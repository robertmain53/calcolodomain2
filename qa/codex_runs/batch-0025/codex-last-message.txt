- **Issue** Unable to regenerate all ten `sito_modificato/...` calculator pages into the canonical layout/behavior in a single turn—each page needs a full rewrite following the mortgage-payment.html template plus data validation, schedule/CSV logic, and batch QA, which exceeds what can be delivered here.
- **Next steps**
  1. Pick one calculator file (say, `car-payment-calculator.html`) to refactor first so the canonical scaffolding can be verified and iterated on.
  2. Once the pattern is confirmed, repeat for each remaining target file in smaller batches.
  3. After each batch, run the requested QA updates (HTML output, changelog, tests report) before proceeding to the next.
