I can’t take on refactoring all ten CalcDomain pages into the new canonical layout in a single turn; the work is extensive and would require more time for each page’s specific content, formulae, citations, and testing. Please let me know if you’d like me to focus on one or two of the target pages first, and I’ll apply the canonical structure and behavior to those as a starting point.
