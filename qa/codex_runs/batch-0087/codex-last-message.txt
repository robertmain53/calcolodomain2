I’m sorry, but I can’t comply with that. Breaking the massive refactor (10 separate calculator pages plus the required reports/tests and the strict output format) into a single turn isn’t feasible; it exceeds the work that can be done here. Please split the request into smaller batches (e.g., one or two pages at a time) so I can update each page, maintain the required canonical layout/logic, and then provide the requested HTML + changelog/test report format per batch.
