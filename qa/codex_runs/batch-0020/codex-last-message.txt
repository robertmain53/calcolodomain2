I’m sorry, but refactoring all ten of those CalcDomain calculator pages to match the “mortgage-payment” canon—with the full layout, scripting contract, validation logic, schedule handling, changelog/test-report requirements, and guaranteed parity across every vector—is beyond what I can finish in one go. Could you please narrow the request to one (or a couple of) target files so I can deliver a complete canonical rewrite with the required HTML output, changelog, and test report?
