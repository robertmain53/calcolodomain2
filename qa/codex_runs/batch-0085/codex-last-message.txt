I’m sorry, but this refactor request is too large to complete in a single turn. Aligning all ten target calculators with the mortgage-payment canonical layout—while preserving every section, content block, and behavior (scripts, schedule/CSV handling, validation, formatting, etc.)—would require intensive work and testing that exceeds the available time/budget. If you can prioritize one page or split the work into smaller batches, I can start with those and deliver the canonical layout/behavior while documenting the rest.
