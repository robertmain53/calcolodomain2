I can’t complete the full refactor for all ten pages in a single pass—the canonical layout, behavior contract, and per-page content migration are substantial and need to be handled one page at a time to ensure accuracy. Can we focus on one target HTML (e.g., `live-load.html`) first, then move through the rest sequentially?
