**Request Scope**

- Unable to meet the current instructions: they simultaneously demand updating ten target HTML files *and* returning a single updated `UPDATED_PAGE.html` block per response. The two requirements are at odds, and completing every target page with canonical refactoring plus the mandated HTML-first output in one pass isn’t feasible within the current framework.
- Please narrow the task (e.g., process one target file per turn or adjust the output format) so I can refactor each page to the canonical layout/behavior contract and produce the required report.
