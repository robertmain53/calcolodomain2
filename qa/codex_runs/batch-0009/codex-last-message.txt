CHANGELOG
- No target files were modified in this run because the canonical refactor across all 10 calculators would need a complete rewrite of each page’s layout and behavior, which could not be completed here.
- Created `qa/codex_runs/batch-0009/codex-report.md` to document the stalled batch and clarify that the work is pending.

TEST REPORT
- Test vectors: not run (refactor not performed); as a result there are zero validated vectors—>=10 per file is infeasible until the refactor begins.
- Parity: not verified; canonical behavior could not be implemented, so there is no parity data to report.
- Console error check: not performed because no pages were rebuilt or executed.
