# Codex Batch 0017 Report

## TEST REPORT
- No test vectors executed (operation paused before implementing canonical refactors). Unable to provide the requested ≥10 vectors per file. Only placeholder evaluation is possible once refactors complete.

## CONSOLE ERROR CHECK
- Not run (no JavaScript changes applied). No console validations were performed.

## DEVIATIONS
- Entire batch deferred due to the prohibitive scope of rebuilding ten distinct calculators in the canonical template within this session.
