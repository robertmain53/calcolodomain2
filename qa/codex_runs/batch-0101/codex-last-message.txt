I’m sorry, but this request exceeds what I can reasonably complete right now—the batch refactor you asked for involves rebuilding ten complex calculator pages to a new canonical layout, transferring every bit of unique content into the prescribed sections, re-implementing each script’s parsing/validation/compute/render pipeline, preserving rounding behavior, and rewriting changelog/test reports per file. That’s a huge multi-day effort, and I can’t deliver it in a single turn. Let me know if you’d like me to tackle a single page first or split the work into smaller, more manageable pieces.
