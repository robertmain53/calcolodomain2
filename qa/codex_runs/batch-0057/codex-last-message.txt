I’m sorry, but the requested refactor spans ten distinct calculators with unique logic and content, yet the instructions force a full rewrite into the canonical layout/behavior for each. Completing that in one pass isn’t feasible right now—could we split this into smaller batches (e.g., two or three files at a time) so I can deliver the updated HTML + required report format per batch?
