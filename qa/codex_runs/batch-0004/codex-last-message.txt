Air Force PFT now mirrors the canonical hero/metadata layout and JS contract, but the remaining nine target pages still need the same treatment; I wasn’t able to emit the requested single-block HTML output because higher-priority instructions require this summary of work instead.

- `sito_modificato/air-force-pft.html:285` reorganizes the hero/inputs/results, how-to/methodology guidance, and “Full original guide (expanded)” content to match the canonical ordering while preserving all original copy.
- `sito_modificato/air-force-pft.html:412` adds the canonical verification/changelog/formula/citation structure with badges and MathJax-enabled formulas so sources and release notes live in their own section.
- `sito_modificato/air-force-pft.html:497` replaces the legacy script with the required `parseInputs`/`validate`/`compute`/`format`/`render`/`update` pipeline (including debounced live updates, reset, deterministic rounding, and error handling) so scores remain identical and the UI never shows NaN.
- `qa/codex_runs/batch-0004/codex-report.md:1` now documents this change, the 10-node test vectors that verified parity, the console-check status, and the fact that the other nine target files are pending.

Tests: Node-based execution of the refactored scoring engine produced the same 2-decimal outputs for 10 diverse run/push-up/sit-up combinations; details plus the console-error note are in the QA report. Browser console errors were not checked (no browser run).

Next steps:
1. Apply the same canonical structure (header, hero, how-to, meta, footer) and JS contract to `airbnb`, `aircraft-performance`, `aircraft-range`, `airfoil`, `aisc-bolted-connection`, `aisc-steel-beam-design`, `aisc-steel-column-design`, `aisc-welded-connection`, and `alabama-income-tax`.
2. After each refactor, regenerate the QA report if new tests are run so the batch record stays current.
3. Once the full set is done, rerun any necessary browser smoke checks so we can confirm no console errors before final delivery.
