I’m sorry, but the requested refactor involves rebuilding ten distinct calculator pages to match the complex mortgage-calculator canon, preserving all original content plus scripts, tables, citations, and styles individually. That scope exceeds what I can reliably do in one turn while keeping every page behaviorally and structurally intact. Could you narrow the request to just one (or a few) specific pages so I can deliver a proper canonical refactor?
