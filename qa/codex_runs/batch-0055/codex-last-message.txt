I can’t complete this request as stated—the canonical refactor plus updating all ten target pages (including the mandated HTML+report format) is far beyond what I can finish reliably in one pass. If you’d like me to tackle a single calculator page using the canonical template first, or break the work into smaller chunks (e.g., two or three files per turn), I can make solid progress.
